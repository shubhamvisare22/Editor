Flask Note Application - Low-Level Design (LLD)

Overview

    The Flask Note Application is a lightweight application designed to manage user accounts and their notes. It includes core features like user authentication, note creation, note editing, and real-time collaboration using WebSocket. This document outlines the Low-Level Design (LLD) of the application.

Components

    1. Models

        The application uses the following database models:

        User

        Fields:

        id: Integer (Primary Key)

        username: String (Unique, Non-Null)

        password: String (Hashed, Non-Null)

        Note

        Fields:

        id: Integer (Primary Key)

        title: String (Non-Null)

        content: String (Nullable)

        users: Relationship with User (Many-to-Many)

    2. Routes

        The application provides the following routes:

        Authentication Routes

        / (GET): Displays the login page.

        /login (GET/POST): Handles user login.

        /register (GET/POST): Allows users to register.

        /logout (GET): Clears the session and logs out the user.

        Note Management Routes

        /dashboard (GET): Displays all notes available to the logged-in user.

        /create_note (POST): Allows users to create a new note.

        /notes/<int:note_id> (GET): Fetches and displays details of a specific note.

        /save_note/<int:note_id> (POST): Saves updates to a specific note.

        WebSocket Events

        join: Allows a user to join a note for real-time collaboration.

        edit_note: Updates the content of a note in real-time and broadcasts it to all connected users.

    3. Error Handling

        All routes include robust try-except blocks for error handling.

        Proper HTTP status codes and error messages are returned in case of failures (e.g., 401, 404).

        Logs are generated for successful and failed operations.

    4. Logging

        A centralized logging mechanism is implemented using a Logger class.

        Logs are categorized by severity levels (info, error).

        Key events like user authentication, note creation, and WebSocket events are logged.

    5. Session Management

        Flask session is used to store user authentication state (user_id and username).

        Sensitive operations like note editing require a valid session.

    6. Database Operations

        The application uses SQLAlchemy ORM for database interactions.

        All database operations are wrapped in transactions to ensure data integrity.

    7. Real-Time Collaboration

        Flask-SocketIO is used to enable WebSocket communication.

        Users can join a room specific to a note and collaborate on editing the note in real-time.

        Changes are broadcast to all users in the room.

    8. Frontend Integration

        HTML templates are rendered for routes using Jinja2.

        Dynamic content is updated in real-time via WebSocket events.

Workflow

User Authentication:

    Users register with a unique username and password.

    Passwords are hashed for security.

    Logged-in users can access their dashboard and perform note-related operations.

Note Management:

    Users create, view, and edit notes.

    Notes are associated with multiple users for collaboration.

Real-Time Editing:

    Users join a room corresponding to a note.

    Updates to the note are saved and broadcast in real-time.
